<h3>panic.com Review</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    Panic.com is a very well built website. Artistically it is very current. The colors, the artwork, the fonts, all compliment each other very nicely to create a very consistent website. The colors are bright and exciting. They display a good mixture of flat colors and gradient areas. They use gradients to give the different sections dimension, especially in the footer. They also use a lot of drop shadows to their font and artwork which also adds to the dimension of the site.The art is very well made and they leave a lot of whitespace so their artwork stands out. The font is clean cut, which is reflective of the website as a whole. Their site is interactive as well by using an interesting animation when the user hovers over the buttons. 
    <br>
Additionally, the subsidiary pages are each have their own unique design. The back button is also cleverly developed. The Diet Coda and Prompt explanation pages both have a video playing on the page at all times that serves as a preview of what they're trying to sell. This video is very well built into the website and is complimentary to the theme and artwork of the page. 
Overall, this website is very well designed. Everything is consistent, artistically designed, and the flow is very well developed. They have a very easy to understand website that provides additional information at the bottom of every page, and simple navigation.
The only critique I could provide to this superbly designed website is on the opening page. They appear to have one primary header, the panic logo, then the text that explains what the site is about. 
 <br>
They have the navigation icons below the header and underneath that they have some links to their blog and t-shirts. The text about the blog and the t-shits is larger than the actual header, it isn't bolded like the header and has a lighter font, but this information should be complimentary to the header. This text draws the visitors attention away from the header but provides secondary information. Also, the font colors don't exactly go together. It would look nicer if the first page had a consistent color scheme, as they do in the icon pages. Other than some minor critiques, this website is very well designed.
