          <h1>About Laura</h1>
          <p> Hello my name is Laura Longworth. I am looking to find a carreer with 3d modeling, art and animaiton. I have experiance with designing games in the Game Design Specialization at Michigan State University. On game projects I enjoy the role of the 3d artist and enviromental asset creator. I am passionate about making great games so I also enjoy the role of managing teams and making sure my group can make a strong project. Aside from games I am also very interested in gaining more experiance with 3d modeling for animation and animating. </p>

         <p> Upon graduation I will recieve a degree in Media Information and Technology from Michigan State Univeristy. I am also working on completing the Game Design Specialization along with my Bachelors.</p>
