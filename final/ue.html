          <h2>What Laura Did</h2>
          <p>On this project I took the role as 3D artist and assistant manager. I created all the 3D assests in the game and the main character animations. I also served as an assitant manager and delegated work to the 2D texture artist. For this project I animated the main character in 3DSMax. I also did all the textures for the enemies. I also set up the interactive menu and did all the audio for the game. </p>
