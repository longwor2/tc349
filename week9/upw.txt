United Pixelworkers website is very consistent and well developed. The theme and artwork fits very well together. The menu is very simplistic which makes the actual t-shirt art stand out. The site works really well and it is easy to understand what to do. The use of custom buttons makes the site look much more polished. The site is also very responsive by making everything have a roll over animation or some kind of interaction. 
The front page does seem slightly confusing because of all the large blocks of color and mismatched information. The front page has products as well as twitter information and podcast information. All of this stuff is good to have on the main page but its not organized in any way and the blocks of color distract the user. The text is just as big as the image its describing and its highlighted a brighter color than the image. I think the text should be smaller and highlighted in faded colors so the image stands out. As well as organizing the page maybe with color correlated information or different sized boxes for different forms of information.
Another thing I would change is the navigation. One of the links on the navigation bring you to a completely different site.The pixelivery link should look different than the rest of the navigation choices so the user knows that it will bring them to a different site. 
Overall the site is very good.
