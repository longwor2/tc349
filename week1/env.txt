I choose to use Dreamweaver as my text editor for a few reasons. First is that I have taken a class in web page design and the class was taught using Dreamweaver so I am already familiar with the environment. Another reason is that I paid a lot of for the Adobe suite and would like to make full use of the programs it came with. I have never used the design controls that Dreamweaver offers and only the direct coding so I won't have the issues you mentioned. As for the platform I've chosen, I am operating on the Mac OS Lion. i choose this platform because the major I choose requires the Macbook pro, and I've come to prefer this platform.
