	The MSU homepage is a very important website to a lot of people. The faculty, the students, prospective students, donors, alumni, and visitors. Every bit of information that is important to all of these people has to be managed by this website and that can be a huge task. The MSU website has to contain so much information, which should be the websites number one priority. Organization and understanding of the users is key to making the MSU website successful. 
	The website has multiple areas to display links to more information. It has two navigation bars, a search bar, sidebar links, and footer navigation. When looking at any side page of the website 80 percent of the page is additional links to more information. I think the most helpful links are those that allow the user to choose their affiliation with the school; the students, faculty and staff, alumni and donors, businesses, and visitors buttons. Even though theses serve as the most helpful links, they are also the smallest on the page. The featured links seem to have very little correlation, but these are more noticeable than the main navigation links. The footer navigation is well designed, with well labeled headers and good organization but they take up a lot of the page. 
	All of the MSU pages are cluttered with information and more and more links. The only exciting imagery is on the main page with their photo slide show. This is nice but the other pages need some personality. You can flip through all of them and unless you read the text they are exactly the same. They should put photos or graphics that visually explain what the page is about to make the page more interesting. The site is overly professional and its hard to see the uniqueness of MSU or the people that make up MSU. 
	Overall, I think the page is a nice design it could just simply use some work on how they display the large amount of information, and to add some more images and personality to the site.
