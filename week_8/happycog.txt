The Happy Cog website is very cool and unique. Instead of having different pages of content they've made the main page contain all of their information. They still have a navigation bar that directs you to the location on the main page the content you've selected is located. I also like that the navigation bar follows the scroll so that you can access the navigation easily. If the user needed to scroll back up the page to use the bar it would defeat the purpose since the only real navigation is scrolling. The style and aesthetics of the site are very well developed and work nicely together.
The only critique i have is that the content all looks the same and isn't easy to distinguish. It would be nice if each section had a different background texture or something to distinguish it so you can tell that its a different selection from the navigation bar.
