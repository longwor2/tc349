A lot of times I need to access Angel information on the go so I often need to use the MSU Angel mobile site. The first thing to note is that visiting the angel site from a mobile device it gives you a pop up that notifies you that the site is not compatible with mobile devices. Even so I know a lot of people that have to access information from the site on the go. The angel site is very difficult to use on a mobile device because it is not scaled correctly to the phone. All the text and buttons are very small and difficult to use. A lot of the links are close together and are text hyperlinks that are impossible to select using touch. Angel also has a lot of menus that scroll within a scroll window and that makes it impossible in some cases to scroll down their information. The entire page is made so that you cannot scroll down and a lot of necessary content is cut off.
One good thing that they've done is link the log in page to the MSU mobile page so that entering your sign in information to angel looks much better. They should also integrate this into the MSU mail mobile site because the log in page for mail is not styled at all.
Overall the mobile site is almost impossible to use because they have not accounted for the use of a smaller screen. They should start by making the buttons and links easier to press with a touch interface. Also, fix the problem with not being able to scroll down the page. Additionally, the use of imbedded scroll windows doesn't allow the user to access all of the information. I think of all the sites at MSU, Angel is the most used and they should have a site that also translates to mobile, as more and more students begin to use mobile devices more.
