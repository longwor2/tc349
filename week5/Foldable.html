<p>Card sorting the Foldable website was difficult. Their pages are very well intertwined so that you can access anything you may need on any page. A lot of their links were consistant to every page so when I organized the site I created a stack specifically holding what was used on every page, so every stack could referance these consistant links. Sorting the site I also noticed that a lot of times there were several different ways to go to the same page on a particular page. This made it easier for a wider range of users because what works for one user may not for another so they gave people options. Also, a lot of the links and categories were very easy to understand what they did. Most of the simpler pages like the about, and the privacy policy pages I kept very simple in my organization because they had the same basic format. Coming up with this design I went through several different versions before I found this one. A lot of similar things I was able to condence and I could make connections easier between pages. The most helpful was comming up with simple paper diagrams to see how everything linked together. I choose to include arrows in my card stacking because I find the way the different pages connect to eachother is very interseting. It would be easy to see where you need to add links and where the connections don't make sense.</p>
