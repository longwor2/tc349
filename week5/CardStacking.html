<p>For my design I looked at the Foldable website as well as these three additional portfolio examples. For the Foldable website I thought it was really important to establish links that are the same thoughout the site. Not only the Navigation buttons, but also links to social media, and ways to communicate. I think this is very important for a portfolio site because the purpose is for employers to contact you. From the <a href="http://www.Neuemodern.com">first website</a> , I really liked how the site opened with a simple logo and links to the real page. Ifound this to be an interesting design idea because it symbolized something of a book cover and a good introduction to the page. I also liked how it had images for the icons of his artwork. Instead of having just text it gives the viewer an idea of what that link will take you to. Also, he broke up each project so he had an individual page to talk about what he did for that project. I would also like to implement this into my site. From the <a href="http://www.idylliccreative.com.au"> second site </a> she also had a page with all of her work and that branched off into individual pages where she could focus on writing more information on that project. I also liked her contact page, it had areas where the viewers could write a message right on the page and contact her that way. The only thing I didnt like about the layout of the site was that direct contact was not accessable on every page. For the <a href="http://www.stephlaberis.carbonmade.com">third site</a> I really liked the simplicity of the site. This site really helped me understand how to work with a small amount of content. Even though she had a lot of photos, she only had 4-5 categories and an about page. The about page was very well designed so that she only needed the one page for background, introduction, and contact information. For my design I wanted to impliment a little from every site. I organized it so that I have the same links and content for every page. I want to break apart my portfolio into 3 differnt categories and from there have a page for every project so I can add text and more informaiton pertaining to that item. I want to design the links to have a sample of that project within it. I would also like to have an opening logo page like in the Neuemodern site. I also want to make sure that I have links to social media on every page to make contacting easier. </p>
