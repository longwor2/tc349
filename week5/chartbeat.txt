The chart beat website has a very consistent theme. All of the art work, fonts, and colors all fit really well together. They use a highlighting color to bring attention to really important features to help navigate the site. The purpose of the site is to provide well designed data items for websites so it is essential that their site is well put together. The site doesn't have a basic navigation set up and the main pages serves as all the content. They have links to additional resources but their main page is really the focus of the site. The main page displays all their information the more you scroll down and I think it may be a better idea to split up all of this information because it can be a little overwhelming. They have a lot of moving images and interactive artwork that can be a bit distracting. They keep the header and the link to try their products on the top of the page even if you scroll down which makes it easy to access this information. They do have additional links at the bottom but they are small and easily over looked. I think these should play more of a role on the site. Overall the site is very effective and well designed.
