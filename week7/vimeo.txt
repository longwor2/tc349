Vimeos website is very artistic and creative. This reflects the use of the website and inspires creative videos. It is also simplistic and allows the users videos to direct the artistic style of their page. Vimeo makes joining and logging in and adding your video very easy. They also have included the ability to add others and keep up with other peoples videos. Vimeos main page does a good job at explaining what their site is all about and it is designed very well. Their web player is also designed very well and looks a lot better than youtubes. Vimeos navigation bar is well done however the buttons don't do what a user would normally expect. Instead of bring the user to another page a lot of them are roll over buttons or they bring up a pop up page. It is designed very well so this difference doesn't effect the quality of their site. They have a lot of different and interesting things on their main page like image slideshows and animations. I feel that this site is very well designed but the footer could use a better design. It looks very different from the site like they forgot to make it fit with the page. The footer also changes depending on if you're on the main page to the other pages. Overall, the site is very consistent and well designed.
