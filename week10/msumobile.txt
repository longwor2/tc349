The MSU mobile site works really well to simplify the information provided on the real msu site. Everything is simplified and easy to find. The information is easy to access for people on the go that just want to find common information like directions, events, and library information. The mobile site can be useful to both students and visitors. They have just some simple icons and a search bar that make the mobile site easy to navigate.
The mobile site also offers some additional information to help the user navigate the site. When you go to one of the icons the title bar is replaced with a bread crumb like navigation. This keeps the user informed on where they are within the site and gives them some helpful links to go back as far as they want. They also use the image of the icon for the bread crumb items which makes it look more customized.
The site does seem to have some flaws because it would be helpful to know what links will keep you on the mobile site as opposed to the full site. For example the news icon takes you to top new articles but if you click on the article it takes you to the main site without warning. It would be better if the user knew what links took you to the main site.
I do however like the feature where you can organize the icons to customize your experience. This makes the site a lot more interactive.
